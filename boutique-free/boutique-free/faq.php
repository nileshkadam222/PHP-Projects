piece than others.We can give you hundreds of similar necklaces but it is not easy to give the exact same ones. 
In this way you will not face any problem to sell them too. 
 	We have a large number of varieties in our stock, but to maintain the uniqueness of the product, we
 always change our designs by every week or max in 15 days so always it is not possible to show you all designs
